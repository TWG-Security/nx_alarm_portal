# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Alarm levels**: Critical, Alarm, Warning or Ignore for each NX event type, set on an admin Settings page. Force-acknowledge NX rules are always Critical. Saving re-levels open alarms.
- **Audible alarms**:
  - Critical: a siren repeating every 4 s. Alarm: a chime repeating every 30 s. Warning: one tone.
  - "Silence 2 min" and a mute toggle.
  - A banner appears when the browser blocks sound.
  - Only one tab plays at a time.
- **Critical pop-up** on every page: site, address, camera, event-time frame, running timer, note and Acknowledge, Show on map, Silence, Minimize, and paging between several criticals.
- **Live alarm feed** on the overview page (right-hand column): level tabs with counts, a running "active for" timer on every card, and acknowledge or open details from the card.
- Soft-trigger alarms are named after the NX user who pressed them; events without a caption get readable labels.
- `tools/fake_nx.py` for end-to-end testing.

### Changed
- Maps moved from Google Maps to Leaflet + OpenStreetMap, so no API key is needed.
  - Tiles are darkened in dark mode.
  - Address search uses Nominatim through a rate-limited `/api/geocode` proxy.
  - The tile and geocoder URLs can be set in `.env`.

### Fixed
- Sites no longer flap offline on one-off relay 503s. A site shows offline only after 60 s of continuous failure; a bad password still shows at once.
- Map tiles were blocked by OpenStreetMap ("Access blocked"): browsers sent no Referer because of the portal's Referrer-Policy. Tiles are now proxied and cached server-side with an identifying User-Agent.
- Caddy `default_sni`, so HTTPS works when the portal is opened by IP address.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29
